Power Supply Functions
Power supplies provide power to all parts of a computer. Here’s what they do:
Convert AC to DC Power:
Provide Correct DC Voltage:
Cooling and Airflow:

Power Supply Facts
Match the Form Factor:
 The power supply must fit the motherboard and case. For example, an ATX power supply goes with an ATX motherboard.


Voltage Switch:
 Some power supplies have a switch to change between different voltage settings. Common voltages are:

 Power Rating:
 Power supplies are rated in watts, which tells how much power they can provide. To find out how much power your computer needs, you can check each component’s watt requirement and add them up.


Modular Power Supplies:
 These allow you to attach only the cables you need, helping with better airflow and reducing clutter.


Redundant Power Supplies:
 Found in servers, these power supplies ensure the system keeps working even if one fails.

 Power Supply Connectors
Different components require different connectors from the power supply. Here are some common ones:
24-pin (20+4 pin) ATX Connector:
 Powers the motherboard.


4-pin 12V (P4):
 Provides extra power for CPUs.


8-pin EPS12V:
 For modern CPUs that need more power.


6+2-pin PCIe:
 Used for powering video cards.


SATA Power Connector:
 Powers SATA drives (like hard drives or SSDs).


4-pin Molex:
 Used by older devices like hard drives and case fans.


 <i> Important: Power supplies can carry dangerous electrical current. Never try to open or repair a power supply yourself. Always replace the whole unit if it's faulty.
