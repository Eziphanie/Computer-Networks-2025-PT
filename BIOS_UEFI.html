<p><b style=" text-decoration: underline;"> UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) </b> </p> 

<p>UEFI replaces the older BIOS. It controls the startup process and loads the operating system into memory.
 UEFI is faster, supports larger drives (over 2.2 TB), and offers better security against malware attacks.
It also supports 64-bit firmware device drivers and works with both UEFI and BIOS hardware. UEFI should be regularly updated to enable new features. </p>


<p><b style=" text-decoration: underline;"> BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)</b> </p> 

<p>BIOS is older firmware that also controls the startup process and loads the operating system.
    It's stored on a ROM chip and should be updated regularly (flashing) to support newer hardware.
    BIOS chips vary in size from 265 KB to 1 MB, and video cards have their own BIOS known as option ROM.</p>


    <p><b style=" text-decoration: underline;"> EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory)</b> </p> 

    <p>EEPROM is a non-volatile memory chip that replaced CMOS. It stores small amounts of data, such as BIOS settings, and allows data to be erased and rewritten. 
    EEPROM chips make it possible to update BIOS/UEFI without removing any hardware.</p>
    
    
    <p><b style=" text-decoration: underline;"> CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor):</b> </p> 

    <p>CMOS refers to both the chip and the settings it stored, such as the boot order and hardware configurations.
        Today, EEPROM stores this data. The CMOS battery keeps the system clock running when the computer is off. 
        You can change CMOS settings during startup by entering the CMOS editor, usually by pressing keys like Delete, F1, or F2. 
        Common reasons to edit CMOS include changing the boot device order, enabling/disabling devices, or setting processor speeds.

    <b style=" text-decoration: underline;"> How BIOS/UEFI Startup Works: </b>


    <ol type="I">
<li>When you turn on the computer, the processor loads the BIOS/UEFI from memory.</li>
<br>
<li>The BIOS runs the POST (Power-On Self-Test) to check the system.</li>
<br>
<li> It identifies and configures hardware, using CMOS or EEPROM settings.</li>
<br>
<li>BIOS searches for the boot device and loads the bootloader.</li>
<br>
<li>BThe bootloader then loads the operating system, and the computer finishes starting up.</li>
</ol>

<br> 

<i><b>Updating BIOS:</b> BIOS updates are sometimes released by the manufacturer. To update, you download the update and use a utility to "flash" the BIOS. Be sure to connect your PC to a UPS during this process to avoid damage from power loss. </i>
